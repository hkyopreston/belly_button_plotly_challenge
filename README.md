# Belly Button Bacteria 

This project was to create a online visual dashboard for belly button bacteria. The samples came from JSON data and were integrated into javascript. 

When looking at the dashboard, you will see a drop down menu with an ID. the ID is one sample (person). The following will update on the dashboard depending on which ID you choose: 

   - The demographic information will change for each sample ID
   - The guage chart needle will point to wash frequency 
   - The bar chart will show the top 1 bacteria species per the sample
   - The bubble chart will change to show the frequency of all the bacterial species found within each sample. The size of the bubble correlates to the relative frequency of all other bacteria.
